EchoFrames is an audio‑reactive visualizer built with the Web Audio API.  
It transforms your music into synchronized image fades, adaptive sensitivity, and dynamic visuals.

## ✨ Features

- Automated sensitivity calibration with rolling average
- Mini blocky visualizer + mouse trail effects
- Ready to host on GitHub Pages

## 🚧 Status
**Beta / Working Stage**  
EchoFrames is still under active development.  
- Performance may vary across devices and browsers.  
- Some mobile phones may not handle audio analysis or canvas rendering smoothly.  
- Highly technical or complex music (e.g., layered electronic tracks) may produce inconsistent beat detection.  

Expect updates and improvements as the project evolves.
